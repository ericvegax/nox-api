# Nox API

The Nox API provides an easy to use back-end for any and all types of Minecraft Servers; powered by TypeScript & Redis, this back-end can handle the heavy lifting in the background, allowing your Developers to focus on developing plugins that make changes to the experience of your player-base.

## Notes
- Cache basic data (playername, uuid, rank, currency, etc...)
- Filter in-game chat when requested
- Update plugins live, without needing to restart the server
- Save complex data to the used database (postgres or mongodb)
- In the future this API will be re-created in GoLang for better performance
